# Music Releases 

Responsive site with new music releases built with react components and data from Spotify API. Built with web accessibility in mind.

## The process

We built the site during pair-programming. Our first project using React in the Technigo Bootcamp. We used different components for the header and the bigger album section, furthermore also one component for the different albums generating information using props. We used the map method to iterate through the data to generate the albums and the artists from a json file containing data from the Spotify API. 

## Accessibility and cross-browser testing 

Accessibility checked with Wave chrome plugin and no errors raised.
Html validated with W3C validation service (http://validator.w3.org/) with no errors found.
Chrome lighthouse report was generated with the result: 100% Accessibility, 100% Best Practices and 90% SEO. 
Testing has been done in different browsers such as Edge, FireFox and Chrome in mobile, tablet and desktop views.
